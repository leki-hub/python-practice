# python-practice
I started my journey in programming and software engineering in Python language.
I just started without a roadmap, nor a guide but curiousity and discpline to learn. 
Python has given me a solid foundation on how computer's  hardware and software architecture.
I just was inspired by a friend in tech to save this templates in my and github account. And this is my first git and github experience.
I wanted just to  create passion and roll with it for  lifetime.
I'm glad God gave me the courage and tenacity to start.
Indeed, nothing is impossible.
